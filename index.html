      </div>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This page examines the self-checkout interface at Target:
        <ul>
          <li>The first section, Interface Description, provides an annotated sketch and brief description of the interface.</li>
          <li>The second section, Interviews, contains the results of interviewing three users about their experience using the interface.</li>
          <li>The third section, Personas: Empathy Maps, has two empathy maps that I constructed based on my observations of interviewees.</li>
          <li>The fourth section, Storyboard, contains a storyboard that I constructed based on the Nervous Nellie persona, which demonstrates the struggles of someone uncomfortable using the self-checkout interface.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <div class="'part-1">
        <h2>Interface Description</h2>
        <div class="sketch-container">
          <img class="sketch-item" src="./photos/sketch.jpg">
          <p>The main component of the Target self-checkout interface is the touch screen, which contains each item scanned, the price of those items, and the total price.
            Users press the 'Pay' button when they have finished scanning their items and are ready to pay. From there, the interface presents four payment options, and the users
            selects an option and uses said option on the smaller screen to the right. 
            This interface is meant to solve the issue of long lines at cashier lines, since the interface is much smaller than cashier lines and thus many can fit into a store. </p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <p>I interviewed three people as they used the self-checkout interface, and asked them the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How comfortable are you with this interface?</li>
          <li>Is there anything you find confusing about the interface, or that you think could be improved about the interface?</li>
          <li>Would you ever pay in cash or add fresh produce with this interface?</li>
          <li>Why did you choose to use the self-checkout instead of the cashier line?</li>
          <li>How likely are you to use self-checkout the next time you visit Target?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Summary of Observations and Interview Responses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users report that they comfortable navigating the interface because:
            <ul>
              <li>They have used it at this Target before</li>
              <li>They have used similar self-checkout interfaces at other stores</li>
              <li>They do not stray from the easiest, known use of the interface; in this case, paying with a credit card, buying few items, and only buying items with scannable barcodes</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Most users report being comfortable with the interface. They are able to use it without looking at it much, maintaining eye contact with the interviewer throughout. One user prefers the cashier line and is not comfortable with the interface.</li>
          <li>Users report that, outside of these above use cases, they find the interface confusing. No users felt that they would know how to pay in cash or add fresh produce, and would rather go to a cashier line than experiment with the interface.</li>
          <li>Perception of time is a significant factor in likelihood of future use. Two users report they will continue to prefer self-checkout because they believe it to be faster. One user reports that she prefers the cashier line because she believes cashiers are more efficient because of their training.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personas: Empathy Maps</h2>
        <div class="maps-container">
          <div class="persona-container">
            <img class="map-item" src="./photos/irene.png">
            <p>Irene likes to be in control of her checkout experience. She feels confident using the interface and feels as though she can go faster than a cashier.
              She likes to decide the pace of her checkout, where items are bagged, et cetera. Two interviewee reported being comfortable with the interface and 
              preferring it because of the greater independence and, as a result, perception of greater speed. Irene represents the users who prefer self-checkout to regular checkout.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="persona-container">
            <img class="map-item" src="./photos/nellie.png">
            <p>Nellie is nervous about using the self-checkout interface. She is worried that she is going to make a mistake she will not know how to fix,
              and feels rushed by the line behind her. She chose self-checkout because it was immediately available, but would be less stressed in the cashier line. 
              One interviewee reported that the interface was confusing and she would feel happier in a cashier line, and that the cashier may actually go faster because of their experience.
              Nervous Nellie represents the users who prefer regular checkout to self-checkout.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The interface had very few instructions, which made it easy to get started but harder if you made a mistake that you did not know how to fix. Overall, I think having few instructions is better, since most self-checkout users are frequent users,
        making ease of use more important than learnability. I was surprised to discover that users felt as strongly as they did about whether self-checkout or regular-checkout was better. These feelings were strongly tied to perceptions of which option was faster.
        All users reported that they felt more responsible for their pace during self-checkout, and the users that felt more stressed by that rush factor were more likely to prefer regular checkout.
        I was surprised to learn the extent to which the rush factor affected user patters; users felt so rushed that none felt comfortable experimenting with new functionality (e.g., paying in cash).
